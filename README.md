# Welcome to the job search!

This repository contains the curriculum for the last four weeks of App Academy. The structure of the job search is less rigid than that of previous curricula, so it's important to know what's expected of you. Check back here every day and be sure to add the [job search calendar][calendar].

Material is divided by week:

* [Week 10](./w10)
* [Week 11](./w11/overview.md)
* [Week 12](./w12/overview.md)
* [Week 13](./w13/overview.md)
