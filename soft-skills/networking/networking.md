NETWORKING

Where once all you had to do was look online and apply for Software Developer job, today, applicants have to work even harder to get noticed.  Statistics now show that job seekers who network are more likely to get noticed and pushed up the review process quicker.  

THIS IS ABOUT CONNECTION, NOT GETTING A JOB
Often, there is a misconception that when networking, job seekers are only there to get a job.  This could not be further from the truth.  When networking, it is about laying seeds for your professional development  (that will need to be watered) and making new friends.  

People believe that networking events can be contrived.  Here is what you need to know.  Networking events are for people who want to meet people for shared commonalities.  Maybe it is a business mixer event or a Hack-a-thon...either way it is about meeting people.  Please remember:  PEOPLE KNOW PEOPLE.  So while you might be at a Church event or playing basketball or an industry specific event, you never know who might be able to introduce you to someone that might be a good connection during your search.

This is not just about today.  The connections you meet now could also help with your career development down the road.

SET YOUR INTENTION
Before you go to any event, set your intention.  How many people do you want to meet and connect with.  For example, “By the time I end this meetup I want to Link In to 5 people and meet up for coffee”

INFOMERCIAL
We know you have a personal pitch, however, what is your 30-45 second infomercial for meeting people?  This also needs practice so that it is on the tip of your tongue.  An example is, “My name is Kelly and I’m a software developer currently looking for a front end role.  Over the last few months I have been spending time growing my skills and am looking for an awesome job and to grow my professional network.”

HAVE 5 GOOD QUESTIONS READY
Prior to going to any event, make sure you have 5 good questions you can ask people such as , “What do you love about your job?”  “What should I know about <company>?” “How did you get into the <blank> industry?”

WRITE DOWN NAMES
Anytime you go to a networking event, as soon as you are done chatting with someone, turn around, get your phone out and take notes.  Often, at these events, it is essential to take some notes about the name of the person you spoke with to add into social media networks.  Throughout an event, people forget to do this and they lose opportunities to make increased connections.

FOLLOW UP
a/A recommends that after you attend any meeting, interview, etc that you follow up within one business day

HATE NETWORKING?
Not everyone loves to network at big events.  Try smaller events if that works for your.  Following are some alternatives for your consideration:
Religious groups
People on your basketball team or drumming group
People from yoga
An app called Shapr which is like Tinder for networking

Social Media (Facebook, Instagram)
Showcase a new project, personal website, resume
Ask for introductions
