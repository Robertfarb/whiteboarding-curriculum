---

## Job Search Overview

* Roll call continues: Monday at 1:30PM, each other day at 9:00AM
* Two additional projects: Javascript and Flex  
* Resume, cover letter, interview prep

Note:
There is less structure, but that is intentional

Typical: work time/office hours, lectures, mock interviewing

## Job Search Strike System

* Coding Curriculum are erased
* 5 strikes = conversion
* Strikeable
    * Missing roll call
    * Not returning email
    * Not meeting application quotas
    * Not meeting deadlines
    * Not passing specs on algorithms projects
    * Incomplete projects
* Every Friday, strike count reduces by 1

# JavaScript Projects

## Games, graphs, and GUIs

---

## Why a JS Project?

* Almost every employer uses JavaScript in some form
* Demonstrate OOP skills
* Add strong aesthetics to portfolio
* Supplements your FSP

Note: Recruiters love pretty things

---

## Project Requirements

* Justify your use of libraries
* Choose something original
* Choose something with an appropriate scope
* Demonstrate front-end skills
* Demonstrate JS skills

Note:
* No tutorials or unjustified of Libraries (No Phaser). Do your research and justify your choices.
* Can be a game, but something original is best
* Can be a data visualization project!
* Choose something with an appropriate scope (youâ€™ll have mornings and evenings over 4 days to complete it)
* Must show off front-end skills -- make it pretty
* Must show off JS skills -- make it interactive

---

## Easy Projects

* [Fishy](https://mthirabayashi.github.io/Fishy_Game/)
* [Beatbox](https://jilldela.github.io/beatbox/)
* [Pong](http://codymcnamara.github.io/pong/)

Pros: less time-intensive

Cons: difficult to make your project stand out to employers

---

## Medium Projects


* [Pretty Peppers (SET)](http://anotherminh.github.io/SET/)
* [Mattress Factory](https://samblyon.github.io/mattressFactory/)
* [On The Dotx](http://www.audreymefford.com/on-the-dot/)
* [AmericanTechIPOs](https://ml653.github.io/AmericanTechIPOs/)
* [AppSentinel](https://kevinshenyang07.github.io/AppSentinel/)
* [Twitter Pulse](https://twitter-pulse.herokuapp.com/)
* [Markov Chain Text Generator](https://jeffreymjordan.github.io/MarkovChainTextGenerator/)

Pros: not a huge step beyond the easy projects, a bit more unique (especially with a good idea)

Cons: require more time and thought than easy projects

---

## Hard/Math Heavy Projects

* Fun with graphs: [planarity](http://www.joyjing.com/Planarity/) or [map coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_coloring)
* [Algorithms visualization](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/) (e.g., BFS with a maze solver)
* [Flocking Simulation](https://schan1031.github.io/Flocking-Simulation/)
* [Cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) engines (e.g., [Conwayâ€™s game of life](https://trevoruptain.com/conways-game-of-color.html))
* Fractal engines, such as [Sierpinskiâ€™s triangle](http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/SierpinskiTriangle/)
* More [cool math ideas](http://www.shodor.org/)

Pros: unique, appeal to geeks, show backend/quantitative chops

Cons: you must understand the ideas deeply, some recruiters donâ€™t understand the concepts

---

## Frontend Demo Projects


* [Sloth Paint](http://jacqueline.soderstrom.me/paint.html)
* [Shortcut Sloths](http://timhwang21.github.io/shortcut-sloths/#/?_k=lljpu4)
* [Spicewheel](http://www.spicewheel.io/)

Pros: unique, show off frontend chops, great interview talking points

Cons: require deep knowledge of CSS and Javascript, must be extremely polished to be impressive

---

## Stretch Projects (Very Hard!)

* [Sudokulor](https://ccankov.github.io/sudokulor/)
* [Mario](http://www.garrettjohnson.net/mario/)
* [Extreme Jelly Bike 2](https://albert2522.github.io/Elasto_mania_game/)

Pros: very impressive to employers

Cons: probably require more time than you have

---

## Adding a Backend

* Basic Node backend
* Ex: persisting User scores or favorites list
* Requirements

Note:
Building a basic Node backend could be a really nice addition to your project, but will require a fair amount of extra work if you have different routes, controllers and models, or need to persist information to a DB

If you want to go this route you MUST make some significant progress setting up your backend over the weekend and show us that you have done this legwork.

---

## Adding a Backend (cont.)

* If you are using an external API, sometimes these APIs are not accessible from a browser (CORS-enabled)
* You will need to set up a small backend to reroute your API calls and serve your project.
* We will provide you a skeleton to help set this up

Note:
Also a common issue is trying to access static assets from your hard drive while in development
Chrome will sometimes prevent the html and javascript files from accessing other files like media; it considers the browser and you hard drive to be two different servers (CORS)
You will need to spin up a development server in your project folder then go to localhost:
Python 3:
python -m http.server
Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
This wonâ€™t be an issue once you deploy to githubpages or heroku, but necessary for development

---

## Common Pitfalls

* Music without a mute button ðŸ˜­
* Projects that donâ€™t utilize the whole screen, or donâ€™t fit onto a standard screen without scrolling
* Games I lose immediately after I start playing
* Projects without clear instructions to the user
* Bad styling, bad fonts

---

## TA Support and Schedule

* Responsible for time management
* Less TA support than during FSPs (intentionally)
* Regular office hours in the mornings with Trevor, Brian, Ethan, Clare, Jon, and Francesco

Note:
You must manage your timeline and progress. We will be checking in with you along the way, but this is your chance to practice implementing your own development timeline!

---

# Project Proposals

---

## Proposal Guidelines

* MVP Features
* Technologies
* Wireframes
* Work you accomplished over the weekend
* Timeline
* Sample Project Proposal

Note:

* MVP Features - Be detailed!
* Technologies - Research! Choose your technologies with a sense of purpose. Please do not use Phaser or Game Engines!
* Wireframes - This is a frontend project :)
* Work you accomplished over the weekend - * Tutorials, skeletons, proof of concept, really as much as you can!
* Timeline - Be detailed! The more granular your goals and checkpoints, the more you will be successful. Think ahead!
* Refer to the Sample Project Proposal as a guide.

---

## Is it a good idea?

* Why are you interested in this project?
* What value does this project provide to a broader audience?
* What is interesting technically about this project?
* Think about how you would describe this project to the recruiter: What story would you tell?

---

## Submitting Your Proposal

* Read and review sample proposal
* Spend your weekend writing an ironclad proposal.
* Work all weekend and Monday morning starting your project; if revisions need to be made to your proposal, that will happen Monday afternoon, but you CANNOT afford to waste any time by taking the weekend off.
* Turn in proposal on Jobberwocky
* Turn in FSP on Jobberwocky!

---

## Looking Ahead

* Job Search is crazy hard! But...
* You will have a lot of autonomy
* You will receieve ongoing support

Note:
* Job Search is crazy hard, harder than what you have done so far. We know itâ€™s hard! But, we shape our curriculum to prepare you for the challenges of the Job Search!
* You will be basically on your own. That is on purpose; in the real world you have to learn a lot on your own.
* Your TAs and Job Coaches are here to support you, but you must show independence and self-direction.
