### Sign Here (10 mins)
var p = new Person('Bob');
p.logName();

1) Can you write me the code to create the function logName and log the person's name to the console?
2) Please write it in both ES5 and ES6


### Minimum Valid Edits (35 mins)
Given two strings as input, find the minimum number of edits to string1 in order to turn it into string2, such that each word along the way has to be verified as a real word via API call. You cannot use a word in your traversal if it is not a real word as determined by the API call.
