# Crafting Resume Bullets

The primary purpose of your resume is to demonstrate to a recruiter that you possess specific
skills. Recruiters spend only a few seconds glancing over your resume so you have to rely on
keywords to tell the story.

## Steps to take

1. Identify a key skill that you will demonstrate. See [this list][keywords] for ideas.
2. Answer the following for each bullet:
  * What did I do?
  * How does it demonstrate the key skill?
  * What was the impact or benefit?

Compile a list of the skills you want to demonstrate, then craft your bullets around them.

## Example 1 (Non technical)
__Skill to Demonstrate__: Leadership

__What did I do?__: Founded company softball team

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Took initiative. Organized long-term project.

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Improved team morale and collaboration.

__Result__: "Founded and managed company softball team, resulting in improved morale and communication."

## TECHNICAL SKILLS IMPORTANT NOTE:  When writing try not to discuss a feature, but try to let the reader know about the feature and what YOU did to make it happen!

## Example 2 (Technical)
__Skill to Demonstrate__: Scaling an App

__What did I do?__: Stored images in the cloud.

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Shows I know how to use AWS S3.

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Reduces server load and allows for scale.

__Result__: "Stores image uploads in the cloud using AWS S3, reducing server load and allowing app to scale gracefully."

## Example 3 (Technical)
__Skill to Demonstrate__: Use of Third-Party API.

__What did I do?__: Determine user locations and filter searches.

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Shows I know how to use the Google Maps API.

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Allows users to search for each other based on location

__Result__: "Integrates Google Maps API with geolocation based searching to display location of other users on a map."


### To help get you brainstorming:

* Did you find some clever way to DRY up your code?
* Did you bootstrap some data to avoid extraneous AJAX requests?
* Did you make some tough choices in your database schema?
* Did you use cookies to store anything other than a session token?
* Does your JavaScript use any math to resize something in the DOM?
* Did you use a library in a way that its author probably didn't anticipate?
* Did you write any custom SQL queries to optimize performance?
* Did you make any trade-offs related to performance, eg. store information that's costly to compute?
* Are you doing any caching?

When answering these questions, the key is to point out features you built that went **above and beyond the basic requirements**.

### Example bullet points:

* Integrated Google Maps API by retrieving coordinates rom PostgressSQL database and presented the locations of the business on Google Maps
* Utilized Flux architecture's unidirectional data flow with React for reliablle DOM rendering
* Used observer pattern to handle management of global Z-indexes for overlapping items.
* Implemented the Ignite framework which employs popular react packages including redux sauce, redux sagas, react native router flux, and react native swiper
* Lowered latency of DB read/write by factor of 7 by using Unicorn to enable virtual multi-threaded processing.
* Used xcode in conjunction with React Native library to hook into mobile device cameras and geolocation
* Designed dynamic data-visualizations with Javascript algorithms based on user input
