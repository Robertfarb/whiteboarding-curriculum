# Flex Project

The Flex Project helps fills in the gaps in your skill presentation not covered by your Full-Stack Project or JavaScript Project. It is flexible because it is designed to show off your strongest skills and to complement the type of job you're looking for.

This should be a small project, similar in scale to your JavaScript Project. You will only have a few days to complete it, alongside attending lectures and completing algorithms assignments. Choose a project that requires sufficient skill to impress potential employers, but not something so difficult you won't be able to complete it in time. Remember--you can always choose to continue adding features during your job search, but what you turn in needs to be a complete MVP.

Here are your options for projects:

* Improve **ActiveRecordLite & RailsLite**, **Chess**, or another backend project
 * Good for **backend** positions, demonstrates OOP, is impressive to engineers
 * Read the [instructions](code_intensive.md) with included examples
* Build a second **[JavaScript/FrontEnd Project](js_project.md)**
  * Make something distinct from your first JS Project
  * If interested in **frontend** positions, make sure at least one of your projects shows off CSS and design skills. The other should show off advanced JS mastery.
  * DON'T make two games
* Create a **[Chrome Extension](chrome_extension.md)**
  * Chrome extensions are just JS, HTML, CSS. You have the knowledge!
* Create a **[Ruby gem or JS library](gem_or_library.md)**
* **[Trade 'n Upgrade](trade_upgrade.md)**: Build out a feature in a classmate's Full-Stack Project
 * Experience working with someone else code, where reading is 7/8ths of the battle!

## Requirements

All projects need to have these elements:

 * README - make sure it has:
   * Description of project, including goals
   * Link to live demo and/or instructions on how to use and run code
   * List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
   * Technical implementation details for anything worth mentioning (basically anything you had to stop and think about before building)
     * Include links to the neatest parts of the code, or embed snippets
     * Include screenshots of anything that looks pretty
     * A few example READMEs are linked from [this page][this page]
   * To-dos and future features
 * Make sure there's no .DS_Stores, node_modules, etc.
 * If improving an old project, go through the whole thing and refactor everything.
 * Once complete, add the new project to your resume!

### Group Projects

If you choose to do one of the above projects as a group, make sure you make use of an effective [Github workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing).

  * Do your work on feature branches.
  * Regularly rebase or merge master into feature branch if master is being updated (at the very least, do this before submitting your pull request and before merging in your feature branch).
  * When feature is complete, submit a Pull Request and assign it to a team member to review your code.
  * Discuss code, make any necessary changes. When assigned team member approves the pull request, merge the feature branch into master.
