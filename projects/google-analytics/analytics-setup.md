### Google Analytics Setup
#### Why Google Analytics?
Job search is a super murky process. At times, you feel like you're just sending out applications into the void, not sure if anyone is even looking at your resume, much less your projects.

Putting Google Analytics on your projects will give us more information to work with. For example, if your projects are getting several hits, but you're not getting responses from companies, then that might be a clue for you to boost up your projects to make them more impressive.

On the other hand, if your projects are getting absolutely no views, then that might be an indication that with your current resume, you're getting screened before the recruiter is even interested in opening up the projects.
