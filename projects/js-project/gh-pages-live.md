## Set Up Github Pages in your Github Repo

+ In the settings menu of your github project repo, scroll down to the section called Github Pages.

![github-pages](./gh-pages-images/github-pages.png)

+ Change the Source from **none** to **master** branch or **gh-pages** branch. It's recommended to create a gh-pages branch for github hosting, but it's up to you. Master works fine too.

+ Your website is now available at {github username}.github.io/{repo_name} ex: johndoe.github.io/coolproject

If you want to add a custom domain like www.awesomesite.com, follow this guide: [Link to set up a custom domain](./gh-pages-custom-domain.md)
